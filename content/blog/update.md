So I made a [github account](https://github.com/vgskye), it got flagged immediately, got it unflagged, added [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/) comments.
Yeah that's kinda it

EDIT:
I forgot that I made my website [open source](https://github.com/vgskye/website) kinda

EDIT 2:
oh yeah for reasons the repo will probably remain private oops
